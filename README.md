# Dijkstra-Banker-Deadlock
DIJKSTRA’S BANKER’S ALGORITHM FOR DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE 

### CSC227 Operating Systems

## Intro 

Deadlock is one of the major problems that may arise in multi-user environments. A process is
considered in a deadlock situation, if it is waiting for an event that will never occur. The result
may be loss of work, reduced system throughput or system failure. In some cases, the price for
making a system free of deadlock is high. However, the system should be guaranteed deadlockfree, because allowing a deadlock to develop could be catastrophic, especially if it puts human
lives at risk.
There are many research areas for deadlock. This project is specifically concerned about
Deadlock Avoidance. There are many algorithms to avoid deadlock. This project is limited to
Dijkstra’s Banker’s Algorithm.
